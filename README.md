# iban-validator
This repository holds the source code for a java spring-boot web-service that validates an 
International Bank Account Number (IBAN).  

It's `validateIban(String iban)` method checks to see:
* if an IBAN has a valid country code 
* if an IBAN has a valid length when it has a valid country code 
* if the modulo operation on the IBAN, in a piece-wise manner (9 pieces at a time), is equal to 
  one

### When running the web-service locally

API endpoint for the validation:

`GET http://localhost:8080/api/validate_iban/{iban}`

A successful validation call will respond with a string message saying so in a status 200 
response entity. An unsuccessful validation call will respond with a string message saying 
why it did not validate in a status 400 response entity.
